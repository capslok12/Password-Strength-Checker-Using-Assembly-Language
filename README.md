I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at BRAC University, working to build a strong academic foundation to enhance my professional life.
Assembly language is an excellent choice for achieving hardware efficiency, and I challenged myself to develop a password strength checker using it.
I am pleased to have successfully completed this project.
We all recognize the importance of strong passwords in our daily lives, yet many people overlook the need for robust password security, especially for social media.
I developed this program to help combat online threats and improve digital safety. I hope you find my work engaging and impactful.
